# @vizzele/react

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- New components and backgrounds:
  
  - **CopyButton** + `useClipboard` (React) and `copyToClipboard` (core): the icon folds into a self-drawing check, light washes out from the press point, droplets burst and an icon-only button releases a "Copied" bubble. Announced to screen readers.
  - **Sidebar**: navigation with a liquid current-page marker on two springs, a hover light, foldable sections, badges and an iridescent edge that follows the pointer.
  - **Footer** and **Wordmark** (React) / `wordmark` (core, `data-vz-wordmark`): giant liquid letters that rise out of a surface, reach for the pointer, wobble when pressed and are lit by a drifting spotlight.
  - Five new WebGL backgrounds: **Aurora**, **Silk**, **LavaLamp**, **WaveLines** and **Ripples** (`aurora`, `silk`, `lavaLamp`, `waveLines`, `ripples` in `@vizzele/core/gl`).
